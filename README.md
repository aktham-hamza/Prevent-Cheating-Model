# AI Face Recognition Attendance System

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement an end-to-end machine learning solution, integrating computer vision, data processing, model training, and API development.

## Project Summary
I developed an AI-driven attendance system that identifies individuals using real-time face recognition. The system provides REST endpoints for easy adoption into larger applications, such as educational platforms or enterprise attendance solutions.

## What I Built
- Real-time face detection and recognition pipeline
- User registration workflow through image capture
- KNN-based facial recognition model
- REST API using Flask
- Automatic attendance logging to structured records
- Clean, modular project architecture suitable for scaling

## API Endpoints
- **Register User:** `/ai/collect_faces?id=<ID>&name=<Name>`  
  Captures face data and updates the recognition model.

- **Recognize User:** `/ai/recognize_faces`  
  Identifies users and logs attendance.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (OpenCV, scikit-learn, Flask)
- Machine learning model training & evaluation
- REST API design
- Real-time video processing
- Modular software architecture
- Practical AI deployment

This project highlights my ability to apply AI techniques to real-world problems by delivering a functional, integrated system.
